# Hypothesis Testing: The Uni-hemispheric Subjective Protocol

To validate the hypothesis that a generative Spiking Neural Network (SNN) can sustain the locus of consciousness, we propose a staged surgical intervention on a human subject (following successful primate trials). The protocol aims to replicate the unified visual field observed in intact brains, despite one hemisphere being synthetic.

## Stage 1: The Synthetic Handshake (Shadow Mode)
Following the implantation of the double-sided CMOS micro-electrode array into the dissected corpus callosum, the "Neutral Core" (running on a local low-latency edge node) begins receiving encrypted spike trains via the Neural Firewall. Crucially, the system operates in "Shadow Mode": it receives biological input and generates predictions, but its efferent (output) pathways are electronically gated. The system remains in this state until the **Generative Error ($\delta$)** between the machine's prediction and the biological hemisphere's actual output drops below the threshold of intrinsic neural noise ($<5\%$ variance).

## Stage 2: The Switch (Hemispheric Transfer)
Once synchronization is confirmed, a reversible pharmacological agent (e.g., propofol) is selectively administered to the target biological hemisphere via the internal carotid artery (simulating a Wada test). Simultaneously, the Neural Firewall un-gates the synthetic efferent channels. The Synthetic Hemisphere now drives the corpus callosum.

## Stage 3: The Subjective Report
The hypothesis predicts that the subject will report a unified visual field. Specifically, if an object passes across the vertical meridian from the biological side (left visual field) to the synthetic side (right visual field), the subject should experience continuous motion without temporal disjoint. A report of "blindsight" (acting on the object without seeing it) would falsify the hypothesis.

## Stage 4: Orbital Migration (The Libet Limit)
To validate space-travel capabilities, the computation of the Synthetic Hemisphere is migrated from the local edge node to a LEO satellite via Optical Inter-Satellite Link (OISL). We predict that as long as the total Round-Trip Latency (RTL) remains under 200ms—well within the 500ms "time-to-consciousness" delay identified by Libet—the subject will perceive no disruption in the continuity of the "Now."
